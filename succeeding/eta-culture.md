  Deadlines easily become an exercise in heroism. We nurture existence that is
  rooted in reality, not announced bravado.

# ETA Culture

**Deadlines:** "By when do you think _you'll_ be able to finish X?"  
When the addressed subject is an individual's identity, it is ego that responds.

**ETA:** "By when do you think, _X_ will reach completion?"  
When the individual is inconsequential to the question, there exists a possibility of true accuracy.
