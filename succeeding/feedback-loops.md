# Feedback Loops

## Monthly Status Check

A moment to unlock growth using the instrument of truth, executed through a 1:1 observational conversation with their leader.

The conversation is anchored around the individual's current progress vis-à-vis their current ascend level. This is also where ascends are confirmed.

This is a space available as a mirror.The individual may choose to skip it at their volition.

During the first 45 days, there are 3 additional status checks on day 7, 21 and 45.

### Why are they valuable

Sometimes, switching from FPP \(first person perspective\) to TPP \(third person perspective\) is easier through leveraging a real third person.

### Process

1. **Self-scoring by the Individual.** Including their state of mind behind the score.
2. **Junior Partner offers their lens.** Includes data, scores and their state of mind behind them.
3. **Facetime** For threads that are more efficiently closed in a verbal conversation.

### Privacy

By default all status checks are private, except for the ones where ascend occurs. They can be made public by the individual.
