# Limits of Engagement

### Happiness

Unhappy people create mediocre value, if any at all. Being able to do meaningful work that makes you happy, is an under-rated career growth-hack. 

Be here only when we are your happy spot. Take self-responsibility.

### 

### Consent

No one owes you anything. The idea that others should act a certain way because you told them to, is violence.   
Use consent instead. Ask if they'd do what you'd like them to do. All consent is explicit. 

### 

### Truth

Lie starts with intent. A concealed truth is also a lie. Choose to be absolutuly honest towards yourself and towards others. Irrespective of however hard the truth may be.

### 

### Non-Violence

You may not bring your agitations when dealing with others. What offends you is your responsibility; address it within.

### 

### Merit-First

Your place here is based on the value that you add, not where you come from or your current identity. This means no entitlement to special privileges/considerations. We see you for you; sans the politics. 

Uphold yourself to this standard.  
   


### Privacy

We embrace a culture of openess within, with consent.   
  
Ask for consent from a partner before sharing any:  
1. Financial  
2. Strategic  
3. Personal  
information about the company or its individuals with the outside world.  
  
Use the work email for creating all other work-related accounts. All such accounts and other work-related properties created during employment are company property and not private.
