# Understanding Truth

## Integrity

Are you really living "your" life, or merely executing learned behaviours \(pre-dispositions\) of the moments past?

Your peace cannot be acquired through external enquiry, it is already within. It exists in the harmony that is a life lived for your own truth.   
Not a life that dances to the tunes of fear, insecurities, delusions, hope i.e. all expectations from the universe to behave at your whim.  
This is the ego.  
  
Only free men create value. To be free, you'll need to drop the ego.

For ego is, attachment to the identity of the person that you think you are in your head. In reality, there is only flow.  


Integrity != Honesty

### Integrity == Your truth in this moment

**Your**  
You are what remains sans the learned identity.

**Truth**  
Observe your life in third person, and why you do what you do. If you are merely executing learned behaviours, where are you alive?  
  
****To be able to observe the reality as is, and not as you want it to be; is a superpower. 

With that perspective, everything external stops being good or bad; it just is. A mere data point. And that frees your neurons to focus on appropriate action, instead of living life triggered.

**In the moment**  
The past exists only in your memory, the future in imagination. Only this moment is the reality.

The ability to exist in the moment, without the baggage of the past or the future; is a superpower. Now, you can 'choose' and be whoever you want to be, including being limitless.

Drop the ego and salvate with service.
