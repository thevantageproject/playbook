# Value System

### Trust

**Consistency:** Principle based decision making. 

**Reciprocity:** Trustless correlation between Performance and Reward.  
  
If performance and reward do not share a direct correlation and/or need a subjective opinion based evaluation, then it isn’t performance that is served.

#### 

### Care

Do what is right, even when you don't have to.   
  
We will treat you as a self-responsible adult, even in times when you may not choose to. To care is to empower, not indulge in someone else's self-pity.   




### Growth

Survival is not the default, extinction is. What stops decays. Always keep improving.  
  
Be ready for a high-paced journey that will keep you on your toes.
