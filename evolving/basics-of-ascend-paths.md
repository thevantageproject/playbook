# Basics of Ascending

### Affordance, not Entitlement.

Every individual's progress here occurs when \(because\) they have grown so much that it becomes stupid to not give them more responsibility. And for no other reason.

Focus all your energy on improving your output. Don't bother with signaling effort. Trust the system.



### Ascend Paths

Operator  
Path of skill-specific knowledge. Going deeper.

Creator  
See the system as alive, not individuals. Look within and outside for unlocking new value. 

Play on your uniqueness. The path is of integrity.

1. Problem Solver path \| Operator
