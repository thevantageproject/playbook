Journey Till Now

Level 1 is about building consciousness at the Individual level. That makes that bet that individual performance can be unleashed.   


Level 2 onwards, that bet is not to be taken. Instead only see things from a system lens. The only bet that is accessible is that a groupâ€™s output can be affected.
