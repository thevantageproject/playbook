## **Path**

**The idea of responsibility will remain the same, its scope will increase as you ascend.**

**L2.  
Process optimizing  
It will be done on you and with you. You will observe and grow. You will be responsible for operating the output and controlling the output. Albeit at a lower scale.**

**There is no such thing as a ‘manager’. Management is a run-time skill to leadership.**

**Global Maximum = Optimising the machine itself**

**This is where you are headed.**

**Working with others.**

**“The best workers tend to love to solve problems — and they hate being micromanaged.”**

**Coach, don’t instruct.  
The latter doesn’t work. Humans don’t work that way.**

**If using the former doesn’t inspire confidence in you. Find another path.**

**Recognising others**

[**The Art Of Giving Recognition — How To Praise Others**](https://medium.com/@Barry.Davret/how-to-give-meaningful-recognition-1e4c21cb0f4e)

**When you force recognition as part of “culture,” it becomes an obligation to give it and a responsibility of the receiver to return it. You both checked off a box, but nobody benefitted.**

**Implementing change through Cuture**

**The gap between aspirational and practiced values is diagnostic of how much your company’s culture needs to improve. The actions you take to bridge the gap is prognostic of whether it will.**

**Influence**

**When it comes to people, controls are temporary in their results. They don’t create loyalty or a following.**

**Not only that, but the controls work against you because by their very nature, they make people feel as if they aren’t trusted. Which means they won’t trust you back.**

**And that lack of trust is a huge limiter on your influence.**

**Trust has to be given before it is received, and there is no influence without trust.**

**But if that’s true, then why do so many organizations rely on control to produce output?**

**In short, because control is far easier to achieve than influence.**

**Think about control like sugar. It’s easy to get. It’s addictive. It’s tasty. It feels good and feeds our ego. It provides instant rewards — so we often ignore that it’s not a long-term strategy.**

**Level 4:**

**9. Talent vs. Genius**

**Society is good at training talent but bad at cultivating genius. Talented people are good at hitting targets others can’t hit, but geniuses find targets others can’t see. They are opposite modes of excellence. Talent is predictable, genius is unpredictable.**

**Use the vantage acquired until now to reach genius. This is your playground. Go out and shine my boy!**

**Decisionmaking**
