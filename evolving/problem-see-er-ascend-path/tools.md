"If we can really understand the problem, the answer will come out of it, because the answer is not separate from the problem."

-Jiddu Krishnamurti  


### Observe

This is a path of Equanimity. Building the muscle to Observe what is.  
Not think. Not Know. Observe.  
Observation builds the ability to Respond, not React. 

Response is change. Reaction is just more of the same.  


Problem See-er path is about building the ability to affect change.   


### Lead 

The popular idea of ‘Leadership’ centered around a heroic ‘leader’ is to be avoided.  


The lens to use is the idea of ‘Leading Indicators’ in different fields. 

Here is a simple list from google search for leading indicators. Use them to get a feel of the idea. The content of the posts is inconsequential.

Leadership is about becoming the ‘leading indicator’ and using that influence to impact change. Nothing more.  
Leadership is a status game. Leading is a wealth game.

You have to be today, where the system is going to be tomorrow.

### Team is the basic unit of the organization.

Team is a group of individuals working together to produce a complete output. 

  
Team is the basic unit of the organisation. The individual is useless in isolation. We can’t even beat a trivial strain on our own. It is only our cooperation that has ensured sapien’s rise to the top of the foodchain.   


This is goint to be a shift of paradigm from the path until now.   
  


Currently, grants acquisition is a team. Each project in execution has a team. Each new experiment will have a team.  
Each project and process is a team.  
Project is a Process that is one time.  
  
  
The look of teams will constantly be changing to business outcomes. 

Individuals are organized around processes, not the other way around.
