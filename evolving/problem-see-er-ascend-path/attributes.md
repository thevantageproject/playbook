**Vantage:**

**Curiosity**

**We are building something that most people don’t know they need. Every day, we are venturing into unknown territory. Thriving at Slack means recognizing this forward position and that you may not know the best direction to head. This means you ask good questions at the right time to the right people. It means being curious about how things work and what our customers need. Curiosity is not being satisfied with the status quo and looking at every problem deeper and from a multitude of angles.**

**Empathy \(vantage of the system\)**

**See what they are, not what they it is.** 

**Building things for others to use is an act of empathy. Every decision made about how a thing is built and how it should be used comes from the worldview of the maker. How well they can see things through the user’s eyes determines the value of their work. No one person can see the world through another’s eyes. It’s all approximation and guesswork. Thus the only way for us to broaden our understanding of our users, to see things the way they do, is through hiring people with as many diverse experiences and backgrounds as we can.**  


**Diligence**

**Business is about watching the details.**

**We know that the success of our product will likely not come from unpredictable lightning strikes but from grinding hard rocks against other hard rocks day after day. To build a product that works well and is magical comes out of effort that looks very non-magical. It is easy and sometimes tempting to say “good enough” but after this is where the best work happens and what makes Slack special. This is also where your best work happens.**  
  
  


**What makes a A-leader:**

**1. Self-transforming mind**

**You are no longer held prisoner by your own identity. Your identity \(and role\) is constantly re-created basis what is appropriate for the team's win at the moment. And hence, can hold multiple thoughts and ideologies at once.**

**Leadership is about serving others, without sacrificing yourself.**

**2. Self-responsible**

**If you are angry or agitated, it's not 'their' fault. If your strategy failed, it's not because &lt; insert a random external event &gt;. The buck starts and stops at you.**

**3. Self-trainable**

**Geniunelly willing to learn from others. Universe is always trying to show you the path, be listening. Listen to others and be able to arrive at what is a win-win for each situation.**

**4. Thinks in systems**

**"This is happening because the incentives are set up that way". Most effecient incentives are rarely monetary in nature. Spend time to understand why humans do what they do. Recommended read: The Theory of Moral Sentiments by Adam Smith.**

1. **Vantage.**
2. **Ability to see ahead**
3. **Autonomous**
