All teams start from the bottom most level, for only individuals have existed before this. Their combination as a cohesive unit aka team is a new, ever evolving and always unique \(in its shape\) construct that needs to be birthed. And then transitioned to peak performance.

The only tools at a leaders disposal are empathy \(not sympathy\), affordance and inspiration. For the constraints of each individual and the collective unit become your constraints. You can't pretend they don't exist and yet, expect an outcome.

What makes a A-leader:

1. Self-transforming mind

You are no longer held prisoner by your own identity. Your identity \(and role\) is constantly re-created basis what is appropriate for the team's win at the moment. And hence, can hold multiple thoughts and ideologies at once.

Leadership is about serving others, without sacrificing yourself.

2. Self-responsible

If you are angry or agitated, it's not 'their' fault. If your strategy failed, it's not because &lt; insert a random external event &gt;. The buck starts and stops at you.

3. Self-trainable

Geniunelly willing to learn from others. Universe is always trying to show you the path, be listening. Listen to others and be able to arrive at what is a win-win for each situation.

4. Thinks in systems

 "This is happening because the incentives are set up that way". Most effecient incentives are rarely monetary in nature. Spend time to understand why humans do what they do. Recommended read: The Theory of Moral Sentiments by Adam Smith.
