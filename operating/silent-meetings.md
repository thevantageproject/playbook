# Silent Meetings

A typical meeting is someone speaking and everyone listening. Silent meetings are their inversion.

Silent Meetings are:

1. Asynchronous 
2. Written
3. Focussed on getting things done



### How-To

1. **Initiation**  
   A meeting doc is created with:

   1. Agenda
   2. Ask
   3. All information needed for individuals to deliver on the ask. 

   Once the doc is shared, the meeting is convened.   

2. **Execution** Individuals respond to the doc, and review other's thoughts using comments. Repeat this process until all threads get closed or need escalation to facetime.  
3. **Closure** Facetime to close all open threads. Conclusion is documented and the meeting closes.
