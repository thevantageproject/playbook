# Taking Time off

### Minimum Offs

We encourage you to take breaks, with peace. That requires psychological safety. Here is our attempt at enabling it. 

1. **Sundays are a mandatory off** Work can wait 1 day. Don’t burn out. Take a break, stroll, and spend time on yourself.   Productivity requires discipline, not heroism. 
2. **Mandatory 50 days off every year** Life will throw uncertainties. Account for it. Do not worry about being left behind. It'll be fine.  50 days off every year, accrued pro-rata every month; after the first 45 days. All days off above this threshold are likely to cost lost opportunities.



### Plan your offs

Account time for \(but not limited to\) the following:

1. **Celebration time** Recommendation to take this after a significant project's completion.
2. **Recovery time** When work output is suffering, take an off and reset yourself. 
3. **Family time** They need you too. 
4. **Vacation** Travel is the best way to expand horizons.
5. **Health** You are likely to fall sick. 
6. **External commitments** Sometimes they'll be unavoidable.



### Requesting time off

General rule of thumb is:   
Days you’ll be away = Days of advance heads-up to give to your team.

Send a request to your Junior Partner and they will help re-organise work so that your absence doesn't impact progress.
