# Joining Contract

We seek to enable a culture of individual freedom, self-responsibility and growth. This approach is contrarian to Indian labor law.  
  
Hence, we stay clear of it. Instead we \(i.e. you and us\) decide and commit to the terms of our engagement that 'we' choose and sign that into a contract. This applies for everyone in the team.

Here is the contract we use: [CONTRACT TEMPLATE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11J0nJaAOqBjHGz4J0JK4b4cW-BGTOc31rpAWuJsjomI/edit)

### Here is more on why we do so:

* We like to engage with each other as free self-responsible individuals, without a bureaucrat dictating what can and can not be done.
* You should only be here because you want to be, not because you 'have' to by some law.
* As a corollary, it incentivizes us to create a culture that entices A-players to stay and easy enough for others to leave.
* The idea of permanancy is untrue. People work together when cooperation is a better choice for them, not because a law says so.
* Do not expect a boss-employee relationship. We are all co-passengers on the same journey, albeit ephemeral \(in the larger scheme of things\).
* PS: This approach also translates into lower taxes for each individual.

### Here is what we do instead:

* 11 month [194J contracts](https://cleartax.in/s/section-194j/) that are set on auto-renew.
* Language simple enough to be human-readable.
* Only the clauses that are needed to document commitment on __[_Limits of Engagement._](http://playbook.thevantageproject.com/principles/limits)\_\_

### Taxes:

* Taxes are applicable on only 50% of your income, at the standard rates. Read: [_How it works_](https://cleartax.in/s/easiest-way-to-file-returns-and-save-taxes-for-creative-professionals).
  * With the current tax slabs, if your income is under â‚¹10 lakhs, your tax bill is 0.
* Applicable TDS is at a flat 10%. Read: [_How it works_](https://cleartax.in/s/section-194j/#Threshold)_._
  * You can view your TDS balance at [_Section 26AS_](https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/Pages/tax-services/online-26AS-traces.aspx).
