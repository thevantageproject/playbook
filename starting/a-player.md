# A-Player Attributes

## A-Player = Autonomous player

What makes an A-Player:

### 1. Mindfulness

Be present in the moment, don't offer ego/identity in your place instead.

A simple hack to achieve this is to view life in third person \(TPP\), instead of first person \(FPP\). Don’t make the game about what you want to do. Instead, make it about what is appropriate. Play to win the game, not make the avatar your identity. Fight for truth, not ego.

Recommended watch: [_How to Win by Daniel Gross \(14:50\)_](https://youtu.be/LH1bewTg-P4?t=890) and [_The Power of Mindfulness by Shauna Shapiro_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeblJdB2-Vo)\_\_

### 2. Ownership

Be aligned to the problem and none other. You think it, live it, exist it. For seeing the problem completely, is the solution itself.

Live life as if it's your own time that's at stake. For it really is.

Sincerity is not ownership. Exactly how motion \(effort\) is not progress.

### 3. Overcoming learned helplessness

> We can not solve our problems with the same level of thinking that created them

Problems \(and hence your limits\) aren’t externally created. They are merely realities/possibilities that appear "problematic" from the current POV.

Noun vs Verb. The latter is liberation. The former is identity, and limiting.

### 4. Learning to problem Solve

When faced with a problem, are you able to break it down into pieces that are familiar, use them to discover an opportunity and then built them back up into the solution.

aka Analytical state of mind.   
  
Watch yourself attempt these questions:

* How many haircuts do you think happen in India every year?
* Raindrops are falling on a sidewalk \(sidewalk is 1m and raindrops are 1cm\). How could we know when the sidewalk is completely wet?
* How do you think the world will change in the next three years?

### 5. Putting in the reps

Remember, the ask is to put in the reps, not hours. The latter is effort. The latter is insufficient. Effort is motion, may or may not be progress.
