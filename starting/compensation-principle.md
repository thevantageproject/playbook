# Compensation Principle

Our goal with salary is that it checks the box of "enough" for individuals who are excited about working here \(because of our mission, people and work\) and then fades into the background.

We follow a level based structure corresponding to each ascend level. The idea is to prevent salary from becoming a guessing game. It's simple and straight forward.  
  
Earnings here have 2 components:

1. **Base Pay:** This is decided by the level based structure and is a function of your skill level and assessment on the [_ascend path_](https://playbook.thevantageproject.com/evolving-at-tvp/ascend-paths/)_._
2. **Success Pay:** This is a function of the process you are the part of and usually adds 2x on your base pay. Success payouts occur when you win.

This structure eliminates the need for a manager that decides your price.  
Instead, it lets your actions do it in a permissionless environment. Thus, putting you in control.

The system is designed to afford a growth of 2x in total earnings for the first 4 years.
