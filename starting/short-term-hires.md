# Short-Term Hires

For individuals that are a good fit, but are not here for the long-term game. Sometimes, we'll recruit short-term hires to plug in immediate gaps in the team.

That does not mean that their engagement has to have a short expiry. The 'short-term' merely refers to their currently communicated desire.

However, they tend to only be used if and when a need arises and on a per project basis.

Short-term engagement work the same as long-term engagements except:

1. No compounding benefits like equity, ascend rewards or dividends.
2. Only eligible for level 1 and level 2 roles.
3. Payouts are on per project basis.
4. No ascend path, day 45 checkgate.
5. No ask of using the OKR + feedback loops. Usage is however, encouraged.
