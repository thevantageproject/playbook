Meet [_Jarvis_](https://playbook.thevantageproject.com/starting-at-tvp/jarvis/): our in-house AI that executes this process, helping our applicants receive a clarity of decision in under 3 days.

Here is the process:

1. **Getting to know you \|** Slack ****This is about understanding your journey, your skills and your desires. 
2. **Getting at ease with each other \|** Zoom ****A 15 minute zoom call to deep dive into your journey with an additional 15 minutes, for any questions you may have. We encourage you to document them before hand. 
3. **Doing a dry run \|** Slack ****We'll invite you to work with us on a weekend work sprint and get a glimpse of what it would be like working with the team. Commitment requires conviction. This is your moment to build that.  
4. **Setting up a win \|** Zoom ****It is sub-optimal to commit to a journey without an idea of where it leads. We'll help you set day 45, medium-term and long-term wins, with a path to achieving them. 
5. **Inviting you onboard \|** Slack We hope you accept.

### **First 45 Days**

> Stoploss is a method used in the financial markets to limit loss from a trade that goes wrong, as a method to manage risk.

Day 45 is your stop loss.

We want to see every individual be productive when working here. It is likely that sometimes individuals make an incorrect decision.  
  
Day 45, is when we'll strongly ask you to observe your happiness working here, and the decision of being here.   
If the answer isn't obvious, we'd encourage you to walk away. No questions asked.
